# Campaigns_Data_Analysis_Cleansing
This Repository is for Analysing campaigns data and cleansing to produce clean data without any NULLS, Duplicates, performaing some mathematical operations etc.

**The code is written in Jupyter notebook in Google Colab and below is the link to access na drun the code  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NrZ5FlYYMWp30QdgVtjT31Pnre8amGL9#scrollTo=2iq0t0F9Ek65**


This code mainly focus on Analysing, cleansing the campaign data by removing duplicates and NULL values and perform mathematical functions based on cleansed data.
The result is then represented using Graph analysis for better understanding.
Having wrong or bad quality data can be detrimental to processes and analysis. Having clean data will ultimately increase overall productivity and permit the very best quality information in your decision-making

Code Details :

Step 1 : Import required libraries
Step2 : Create Campaign Sample data 1
Step 3: Create Campaign Sample data 2
Step 4 : Merge or combine the data 1 and data 2
Step 5 : Remove Duplicates
Step 6 : Check for Null values
Step 7 : Remove Null value rows
Step 8 : Calculate sum of amount for each store and for each week
Step 9 : Plot the graph
